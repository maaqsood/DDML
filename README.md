Drowsiness Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and facial motion analysis. 
The main objective is to help improve road safety by alerting drivers when signs of drowsiness or reduced alertness are detected.
